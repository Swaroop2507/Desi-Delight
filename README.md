## Project Structure

The project is organized into different components and context providers that manage the state and render the UI. Below is an explanation of each key component and context provider.

### Components

1. **Header**
   - Path: `./components/Header.jsx`
   - Description: The `Header` component is responsible for displaying the navigation bar and any relevant information like the app logo, and cart summary. It serves as the entry point for the application, setting the tone and layout for the rest of the UI.

2. **Meals**
